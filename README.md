# Task of Programming Algorithms
This is a collection of my algorithmic and programming 2 course assignments. 
If you want to use it please let me know beforehand. 
I uploaded it to github so my friends can learn from my program.
I'm not very good at it yet. And this all is still basic. Please forgive me, if there are some mistakes.
